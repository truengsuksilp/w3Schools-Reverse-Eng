=== Sass ===
+ Organization of CSS is nice
- Sometimes code gets too nested and makes bracket management difficult
Summary:

=== Bulma ===
+ It was nice to have certain elements readily available, and management by class made applying properties easy. 
- Bulma default stylings were a challenge to override at times, and if I ever found myself stuck on an issue and couldn't find a reason for it, these default stylings were often the reason
Summary: There is still a lot to learn in terms of what Bulma is capable of and how to really customize it to fit needs.

=== Teamwork! ===
* Communication is key!
* Working on code that someone else created can be difficult
* Another set of eyes to review and provide fresh perspective is very handy
* Great to be able to divide and conquer and assign tasks based on our strengths
